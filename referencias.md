Abstract
It has been recognized worldwide that consideration of cumulative impacts should be an integral part of the environmental impact assessment process and that sector-specific methodologies should be evolved to address these impacts. A generic methodology for cumulative impact assessment of opencast mining projects has been developed with special reference to air quality assessment. It involved questionnaire checklists and a geographical information system for scoping of the impact assessment study, and the ISCST3 air quality dispersion model for the analysis of impacts. Its use was illustrated by a case study at an opencast iron ore mine. The methodology could identify a number of potentially significant cumulative impacts. Also, the analysis of air quality impact suggested that in some areas surrounding the mine the cumulative pollutant levels could be significantly high even if the effects of project-related impact were low.


Methodological considerations in developing local-scale health impact assessments: balancing national, regional, and local data

Abstract
National-scale health impact assessments (HIAs) have been conducted for many years and have become reasonably systematized. Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing HIA methods at local scales, in the context of Environmental Public Health Tracking and in other settings. This paper investigates the data and analytical challenges to estimating the incidence of health effects associated with changes in air pollution concentrations at the local scale, focusing on ozone and fine particulate matter. Although it could be argued that the local-scale HIA is simply a more geographically discrete version of the national-scale assessment and, therefore, has similar challenges, in practice, many key inputs in national-scale assessments are assumed to be spatially uniform or vary only at coarse geographic resolution. For a national-scale assessment, this assumption may not contribute appreciable bias, but the bias could be significant for any individual location. Thus, local-scale assessments require more geographically resolved air quality data, concentration–response (C-R) functions, and baseline incidence rates than are often used. However, comprehensive local data may not be available, may be incomplete, or may be time-intensive and resource-intensive to develop, especially for C-R functions for which small-scale epidemiological studies will often be underpowered. Given this context, this paper considers how best to develop credible local-scale HIAs, identifying factors that contribute to variability across geographic areas, study designs, and time periods. This paper also describes which key sources of analytical uncertainty change as the scope shifts from the national to the local scale. These challenges notwithstanding, the paper concludes that a well-designed local-scale HIA, following key principles and recommendations, can be both informative and defensible.

Abstract
This paper presents a methodology for conducting an objective comparative evaluation of two air–quality models using several datasets. This methodology is designed to be simple to implement and understand, to reliably discern improvement in performance, and to accommodate the use of datasets from a variety of field studies of varying quality. The reliability of the comparison is enhanced by the segregation of the data into stability and distance regimes. The application of the methodology to compare two air–quality models, using four datasets, demonstrates its use as a practical means for comparing model performance.
