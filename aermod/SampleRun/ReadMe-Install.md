Try Me First - Read Me First

These instructions are to help the first time user of 
AERMOD and its associated programs to install, setup, and 
run a simple test case.

System Requirements:

	Any modern PC that meets the recommended, not minimum, 
	RAM memory and CPU requirements of the respective 
	Operating System should be adequate enough to run the 
	AERMOD modeling system.   Any computer system recently 
	built as a "work station" should have more than enough 
	RAM memory, CPU processing power, and hard drive space 
	to run AERMOD.

  If your system meets these requirements, please proceed. 
  If you need help, please contact us through the
  "Contact Us" link on our SCRAM Web Site.
