[Analytical Description and Vertical Structureof the Atmospheric Boundary Layer](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5ab18e5aaa7faea6d863748e/5ab18e5aaa7faea6d86374a0/x/c4dd6a9f0c0ae91955f186d9802b6953/ch02_Analytical_Atmospheric_Boundary_Layer.pdf)

The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the lower part of the troposphere, and by 
this the lowest layer of the atmosphere as a whole. In contrast to the free atmosphere 
above, the presence of the underlying Earthâ€™s surface has a measurable influence 
on the ABL. It is the only part of the atmosphere where frictional forces play an 
important role, and where the temperature can exhibit a diurnal variation. The ABL 
acts as a kind of broker that communicates the transport of energy, momentum, and 
other substances between the Earth surface and the free atmosphere, i.e. the ABL 
is dominated by vertical fluxes of these variables. These fluxes have their largest 
amounts directly at the surface and vanish at the top of the ABL.
